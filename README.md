# frameworks-3

Same project as midterm

Running bun run dev in the root dir should run both the client and server 

See the .env.example in the packages/backend folder for kinde setup

PS

if you're seeing this i have not finished and it's mostly broken
i'm gonna handle it tomorrow
i may have put a little too much time into idsp and not enough into this
i like the stack tho
